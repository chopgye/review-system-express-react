# Restaurant Reviews

## About 
This app was built purely using javascript with react on the frontend and nodeJS with Express on the backend. Since I already did a project with server side rendering I wanted to try one with client side rendering, so I cover both end of the spectrum. This is a simple review app that allows users to add reviews for specific restaurants including star ratings. For this project I decided to not use an ORM and do all my database operations using raw SQL.

## Installation
```JavaScript
$ npm start --prefix server
$ npm start --prefix client
```
